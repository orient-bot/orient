## The Why

Software is being rewritten. Not just the code - the entire practice of building it.

We're gathering Israel's software ecosystem - investors, founders, engineers, builders - for one evening to collectively understand **The Shift**: how AI is fundamentally changing software development, company building, and the broader job market.

This isn't another AI hype event. It's a raw, authentic showcase of what's actually being built, followed by an honest conversation about what it means.

## The Who

**500 carefully curated attendees:**
- Venture Capitalists & Angel Investors
- Founders & Entrepreneurs
- Software Engineers & Architects
- Product & Tech Leaders
- Executives from Israel's leading tech companies

**The vibe:** Demo-day energy. Real builders. Real work. No polished corporate keynotes.

## Evening Flow (3.5 hours)

### 🎤 Opening (15 min)
Welcome & context setting. Why we're here tonight. Framing "The Shift."

---

### 🔧 Builders Summit Part 1: "The Burden Bearers" (30 min)
**AI for Mature Codebases | 3-4 presentations × 7 min**

How are teams using AI to navigate complex, existing systems? Real war stories from production.

*What we're looking for:*
- Refactoring large codebases with AI assistance
- AI-powered code review at scale
- Migrating monoliths with AI copilots
- Overcoming the "context window" challenge in 500K+ LOC

---

### ☕ Networking Break (15 min)

---

### ⚡ Builders Summit Part 2: "The Vibe Coders" (30 min)
**Solo builders, AI-native products | 3-4 presentations × 7 min**

One person, AI tools, remarkable output. Products that would have taken teams now built by individuals.

*What we're looking for:*
- "I built this SaaS in a weekend"
- From idea to production with minimal traditional coding
- The new economics of solo development
- When vibe coding works (and when it breaks)

---

### 🤖 Builders Summit Part 3: "Software 3.0" (30 min)
**Agentic Applications | 3-4 presentations × 7 min**

When the AI isn't just helping write code - it IS the product. Autonomous agents as the core value proposition.

*What we're looking for:*
- Agents that replace workflows, not just assist
- Building trust with autonomous systems
- The UX of agent-first products
- Real production agentic apps (not demos)

---

### ☕ Networking Break (20 min)
*Topic corners: AI-First Investing | Building with Agents | The Future of SaaS*

### 💬 Panel: "The Great Rewrite" (50-60 min)
**Hosted by Shaul Amsterdamsky (Kan 11)**

An honest conversation about what The Shift means - for developers, for companies, for Israel's tech ecosystem.

**Panelists:** Mix of investors, tech executives, and builder/influencer voices.
*(Names TBD)*

**Discussion threads:**
1. **The Role Question** - What happens to developers? Augmented or replaced?
2. **The Investment Thesis** - What makes an "AI-first" company investable in 2025?
3. **The SaaS Question** - Is traditional SaaS dead? What replaces it?
4. **The Path Forward** - Acknowledge the disruption, show the opportunity

*Tone: Balanced. We don't shy away from hard questions, but we focus on what can be built.*
