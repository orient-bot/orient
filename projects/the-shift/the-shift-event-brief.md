## The Why

Software is being rewritten. Not just the code - the entire practice of building it.

We're gathering Israel's software ecosystem - investors, founders, engineers, builders - for one evening to collectively understand **The Shift**: how AI is fundamentally changing software development, company building, and the broader job market.

This isn't another AI hype event. It's a raw, authentic showcase of what's actually being built, followed by an honest conversation about what it means.

## The Who

**500 carefully curated attendees:**
- Venture Capitalists & Angel Investors
- Founders & Entrepreneurs
- Software Engineers & Architects
- Product & Tech Leaders
- Executives from Israel's leading tech companies

**The vibe:** Demo-day energy. Real builders. Real work. No polished corporate keynotes.
